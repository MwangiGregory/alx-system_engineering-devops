# Load balancer
In this task I learnt about Load balancers.A load balancer is a software or hardware that distributes web traffic
to backend servers that respond to the requests with the aim of preventing overload of a increasing redundancy.
I learnt about the different types of load balancers namely:
- Hardware Load balancer - this is a dedicated hardware that distributes web traffic to backenc servers
- Software Load balancer - this is a software installed onto a machine that performs load balancing

Software load balancers utilize different algorithms to distribute load. Here are the basic algorithms:
- Round Robin
- Weighted Scheduling Algorithm
- Least Connection First Scheduling

Hardware load balancers can be categorized into two, namely:
- Layer 4 hardware laod balancing
- Layer 7 hardware laod balancing
