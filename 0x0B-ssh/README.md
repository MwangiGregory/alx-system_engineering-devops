# SSH

In this task, I learnt how to work with ssh to access servers remotely in a secure way. SSH is an acronym for Secure Shell and is a protocol for connecting and executing commands on a terminal of a remote server. SSH uses password and public private key authentication. In this task I learnt how to setup, configure and use SSH with the public private method of authentication which is more secure.

The keys are an asymetric pair. The public key can be shared freely with anyone whereas the private key has to be safely guarded.
