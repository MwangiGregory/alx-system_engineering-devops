# HTTPS

In this task, I learnt about https and the protocols used for encryption of http traffic namely: Transport layer security(TLS) and Secure socker layer(SSL)

I learnt how to configure my haproxy load balancer to terminate the https connection. This involved decrypting incoming https traffic and passing it to pre-configured webserver via a private network. It also encrypted outgoing responses from the webservers.

I leveraged the dig command to make dns queries and awk to extract and format information gotten from the dig command.
