# Configuration Management

In this assignment, I learnt about server configuration management. This is a process that involves managing setup, deployment and state of servers in a way that ensures integrity of a system over the system's lifetime.

Server confguration managament can also be refered to as Server ochestration. It is a way to automate the configuration process of a system with many servers involved.

In this task, I specificaly learnt how to use the Puppet configuration management tool.
